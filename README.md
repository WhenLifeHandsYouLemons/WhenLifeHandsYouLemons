# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sooraj and I'm a student who is passionate about technology and software development. My hobbies include 3D modelling, coding, photography, and more. You can view all of my work and other stuff on my personal website: [sooraj.dev](https://sooraj.dev/).

Specifically, I'm interested in **software development**, **game development**, and **applying AI/ML** to improve everyday life and help make the world a better place through technology.

"Imagination is the discovering faculty, pre-eminently. It is that which penetrates into the unseen worlds around us, the worlds of Science. It is that which feels & discovers what is, the  real which we see not, which  exists not for our  senses. Those who have learned to walk on the threshold of the unknown worlds, by means of what are commonly termed par excellence  the exact sciences, may then with the fair white wings of Imagination hope to soar further into the unexplored amidst which we live." -->
